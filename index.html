                <p class="info">The origins of what is now known as the Kit Kat brand go back to 1911, when Rowntree's, a confectionery company based in York, England, trademarked the terms Kit Cat and Kit Kat. The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. </p>

                <p>KitKat is a popular chocolate-covered wafer bar that was first introduced in 1935 by the British confectionery company Rowntree's.
                    It was initially called “Chocolate Crisp” before being rebranded as KitKat in 1937. KitKat's iconic shape features four finger-like bars that can be snapped apart, making it a shareable treat.

                <p>The name “KitKat” is believed to have been inspired by a type of medieval manual called “Kit-Cat,” which was a reference to a popular British mutton pie. 
                    KitKat is known for its distinctive “Have a Break, Have a KitKat” slogan, emphasizing its role as a snack to be enjoyed during breaks. KitKat bar was made with milk.</p>

                <p>KitKat has a strong presence in Japan, where it has become synonymous with good luck due to its similarity in pronunciation to the Japanese phrase “kitto katsu,” meaning “surely win.”
                    KitKat's popularity in Japan has led to the introduction of numerous unique and limited-edition flavors, such as green tea, wasabi, and sake.</p>
